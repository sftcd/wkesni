           A well-known URI for publishing service parameters
                        draft-ietf-tls-wkech-10

Abstract

   We define a well-known URI at which an HTTP origin can inform an
   authoritative DNS server, or other interested parties, about its
   Service Bindings.  Service binding data can include Encrypted
   ClientHello (ECH) configurations, that may change frequently.  This
   allows the HTTP origin, in collaboration with DNS infrastructure
   elements, to publish and rotate its own ECH keys.  Other service
   binding data such as information about TLS supported groups is
   unlikely to change quickly, but the HTTP origin is much more likely
   to have accurate information when changes do occur.  Service data
   published via this mechanism is typically available via an HTTPS or
   SVCB resource record.

1.  Introduction

   The Service Bindings (SVCB) in DNS RFC [RFC9460] defines how to
   handle information needed to make connections to services by using a
   new DNS record set (RRset) with the HTTPS or SVCB resource record
   type.  Many HTTP origins are managed by proprietary systems that
   enable coordinated control of the TLS server configuration and the
   DNS zone file contents.  For example, a single configuration source
   might be used to set the ECH keys for TLS and populate the DNS zone

   file.  However, some deployments manage TLS and DNS separately, and
   require a mechanism like the one defined here to pass information
   from the TLS server to the DNS zone.

   Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] for TLS1.3 [RFC8446]
   defines a confidentiality mechanism for server names and other
   ClientHello content in TLS, and there is a well-defined way
   [I-D.ietf-tls-svcb-ech] to include Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)
   configuration information (ECHConfigList values) in HTTPS or SVCB
   RRsets.  Each ECHConfigList value contains a list of the public
   components of a key pair that will typically be periodically
   (re-)generated by a TLS server.

   This document uses ECH to provide a concrete motivating example, but
   the mechanism defined here can be used to deliver other kinds of
   service information about the origin, intended to be published in
   HTTPS or SVCB RRs.  Other use cases, such as the TLS preferred groups
   service parameter defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-key-share-prediction], can
   also be supported via this mechanism.

   We use the term "zone factory" (ZF) for an entity which can validate
   service binding data and that has write access to the zone file.  We
   assume the ZF can also make secure HTTP requests to the origin to
   validate service binding data that the origin has asked to be
   published.  We define a well-known URI [RFC8615] on the origin server
   that allows the ZF to poll for changes to service binding data.

   For example, if a web server generates new ECHConfigList values
   hourly and publishes those at the well-known URI, the ZF can poll
   that URI.  When the ZF sees new values, it can check if those work,
   and if they do, then update the zone file and re-publish the zone.
   If ECH is being operated in split-mode then the web server (backend)
   can similarly poll via the ECH client-facing server at the well-known
   URI and then create its own value to publish for the ZF to read.  ECH
   split-mode is defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] and an example is
   provided below (Section 3).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We define or re-use the following terms:

   Zone factory (ZF):  an entity that has write-access to the

      authoritative DNS server zone database.

   Client-Facing Server (CFS):  the web server that has an ECH private
      value.  This processes the outer ClientHello and attempts ECH
      decryption.  The name of client-facing server will typically be
      the public_name value used in an ECHConfig.

   Backend:  the web server that will process the inner ClientHello.
      Note that even if client-facing server and backend are on the same
      web server, they almost certainly have different DNS names.

   Shared-mode:  this is where client-facing and backend servers are the
      same web server.

   Split-mode:  this refers to the case where the client-facing server
      only does ECH decryption but the TLS session is between the client
      and backend, which will typically be on a different host to
      client-facing server

   regeninterval:  the number of seconds after which the value retrieved
      after acessing a well-known URI may be changed.

3.  Example uses of the well-known URI for ECH

   Some example ECH deployments are outlined here.

          Figure 1: Shared-Mode Topology with Zone Factory and DNS

   The shared-mode ECH server generates new ECHConfigList values every
   "regeninterval" seconds via some regular, automated process (e.g., a
   cronjob).  ECHConfigList values are "current" for an hour, and remain
   usable for three hours from the time of generation.  The automated
   process updates the ECHConfigList values in a JSON resource (see
   Figure 5) at the well-known URI, https://backend.example.com/.well-
   known/origin-svcb.

   These steps may then occur:

   1.  On the ZF, another regularly executed job uses an HTTP client to
       retrieve this JSON resource from backend.example.com.  The data
       MUST be fetched via HTTPS and the certificate validity MUST be
       verified.

   2.  If there is no change to the JSON content, then the ZF is done
       processing for this backend.  If there is a change to the JSON
       content, the ZF attempts to connect to backend.example.com using
       these ECH values and confirms that they are working.

   3.  The ZF observes that the JSON resource has a regeninterval of
       3600 seconds, and chooses a DNS TTL of 1800.  It updates the DNS
       zone file for backend.example.com and re-publishes the zone
       containing the new ECHConfigList values instead of the old.

   When "regeninterval" seconds have passed, the ZF attempts to refresh
   its cached copy of the JSON resource.  If the resource has changed,
   it repeats this process.

   The JSON file produced in this example might be as shown in Figure 2,
   and the resulting HTTPS RR might then be as shown in Figure 3.  (New-
   lines are added for presentation.)

   In this section, we describe one possible way in which ECH split-mode
   could be deployed and make use of this .well-known scheme.  There are
   of course various other deployment options that might be more
   effective.

          Figure 4: Split-Mode Topology with Zone Factory and DNS

   In this topology, the overall process is as in the previous section,
   but with the following differences:

   1.  The CFS is a load-balancer and only does ECH decryption.  The
       load-balancer is called cfs.lb.example.

   2.  Traffic between the CFS and backend is protected using some kind
       of VPN.

   3.  The A/AAAA values for backend.example.com and cfs.lb.example are
       the same.

   4.  backend.example.com content is hosted on some machine(s)
       accessible via the CFS and then via the VPN.  (In Figure 4 this
       is shown as "REAL backend.example.com".)

Internet-Draft           Well-Known URI for SVCB            October 2025


   5.  backend.example.com wants to acquire the ECH config information
       from the CFS by querying the CFS' .well-known URL, in this case
       https://cfs.lb.example/.well-known/origin-svcb

   6.  backend.example.com then publishes its chosen JSON (presumably
       including the relevant ECH config information) at
       https://backend.example.com/.well-known/origin-svcb That resource
       is hosted on the "REAL" backend.example.com machine.

   7.  The ZF attempts to connect to https://backend.example.com using
       the generated HTTPS record(s), including the relevant ECH values,
       and confirms that all is working before updating the zone.

   Note that in this example the ZF does not necessarily know that ECH
   split-mode is in use.

4.  The origin-svcb well-known URI

   If backend.example.com wants to convey information to the Zone
   Factory, it publishes the JSON content defined in Section 5 at:
   https://backend.example.com/.well-known/origin-svcb

   The well-known URI defined here MUST be an "https" URL and therefore
   the ZF can verify the correct backend is being accessed.

   If new service binding data fails to validate (as per Section 6),
   then the ZF MUST NOT modify the zone.

   If the origin desires some particular service binding data be
   included in an HTTPS or SVCB resource record, then it MUST include
   the relevant value(s) in the JSON resource published at the well-
   known URI.  A ZF may seperately be configured to add additional
   information to the published resource records as desired, but that is
   a matter for local agreement.

   With this scheme, web origins can only "speak for themselves" so that
   if the backend is e.g. at port 8443 rather then the default 443, then
   the ZF MUST access https://backend.example.com:8443/.well-known/
   origin-scvb when considering modifications to the HTTPS/SVCB records
   for _8443._https.backend.example.com.  As a consequence, a ZF will
   need to be configured to periodically refresh the JSON resource for
   each origin separately; that is, a ZF cannot "discover" from port 443
   that some other service, for which the ZF is expected to update the
   DNS, is also present on another port on the same host.

5.  The JSON structure for origin service binding info

           }]
         }

                    Figure 6: Sample JSON with aliasing

   The JSON file at the well-known URI MUST contain an object with two
   keys: "regeninterval", whose value is a number, and "endpoints" whose
   value is an array of objects.  All other keys MUST be ignored.

   The "regeninterval" must be a positive integer and specifies the
   number of seconds between e.g.  ECH key generation actions at the
   origin; that is, a replacement ECHConfigList may be generated this
   often.  This is used to determine when to next poll the origin for
   updates, and MAY be used by the ZF to generate DNS TTL values, for
   example with a TTL that is half of the regeninterval.

   More precise expiration times are common in other protocols (e.g.,
   the "notAfter" field in certificate lifetime validity, discussed in
   Section 4.1.2.5 of [RFC5280]), but are too stringent for this use-
   case.  The ZF cannot afford to fail open (by removing the HTTPS
   records) or fail closed (by removing the IP addresses), but it can
   safely "stretch" the lifetime of the HTTPS records because of ECH's
   "retry_configs" behavior.  Since we have to accept this stretching,
   it makes sense to avoid an explicit expiration time and instead speak
   about the intended update frequency.  This also make it clear the
   origin must tolerate some amount of version skew, and gives
   operational flexibility to avoid unreasonable update frequencies.

   The "endpoints" key is an array of objects.

   *  An empty endpoints array MUST be treated as an error.

   *  An endpoints array with one element can be one of three things:

      1.  An empty object, which the ZF should take to be an HTTPS
          record with inferred SvcPriority, a TargetName equal to ".",
          and no specific service binding data, e.g. no ECH support.
          This can can be useful as a simple way to make use of the
          HTTPS RR type's HSTS behavior.

      2.  A ServiceMode entry, containing at least one key from the JSON
          HTTP Origin Info registry (see IANA Considerations
          (Section 9), below).

      3.  An AliasMode entry that points to another DNS name that must
          be resolved.

   *  If the endpoints array has more than one element, every item
      SHOULD be a ServiceMode entry, due to restrictions on the use of
      multiple AliasMode records (see , Section 2.4.2 [RFC9460]).

   This format is designed to allow full use of the capabilities of
   HTTPS records [RFC9460] in natural JSON while minimizing the risk of
   invalid configurations.

   The following keys are defined for ServiceMode entries:

   target:  The value is a string containing a fully qualified domain
      name corresponding to the HTTPS record's TargetName with the final
      "." removed.  The default value is the empty string (""),
      corresponding to a TargetName of ".".  To avoid complex conversion
      logic, the characters in this value MUST be limited to lower ASCII
      letters, digits, "-", "_", and "."  (ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" /
      "." in ABNF [RFC5234]).  These are the characters used in
      preferred name syntax [RFC1034] and underscore labels.

   priority:  The value is a positive integer corresponding to the
      SvcPriority.  If omitted, the ZF SHOULD use the SvcPriority from
      the previous element of the endpoints array (or the value one for
      the first element).

   params:  A JSON Dictionary representing the SVCB SvcParams.  Each key

      in the dictionary is a string containing a registered SvcParamKey
      name (e.g., "ipv6hint") or a SvcParamKey in generic form (e.g.,
      "key65528").  Where a registered SvcParamKey name exists and is
      supported, the relevant generic form SHOULD also be supported,
      e.g. an implementation that supports "ech" SHOULD also accept
      "key5" as meaning the same thing.  The default value is "{}".

      *  For single-valued SvcParams (e.g., "ech"), the value is a JSON
         String.  A JSON String is a sequence of Unicode codepoints,
         while a SvcParam's presentation value is a sequence of octets,
         so each value octet is stored as a single Unicode codepoint
         [ISOMORPHIC-DECODE].  In almost all cases, this is equivalent
         to the ordinary string representation of the presentation
         value.

      *  For list-valued SvcParams (e.g., "alpn"), the value is a JSON
         Array of Strings.  Each String represents an octet sequence, as
         in the single-value case.

   The following key is defined for AliasMode entries.

   alias:  The value MUST be a DNS name that could be used as the
      TargetName of an HTTPS resource record.  This indicates that the
      backend is hosted on the same endpoints as this target, and is
      equivalent to an HTTPS AliasMode record.  The ZF might implement
      this directive by publishing an AliasMode record, publishing a
      CNAME record, copying HTTPS records from the target zone, or
      fetching https://cfs.example.com/.well-known/origin-svcb (if it
      exists).

   These definitions, taken with the ZF behaviour (Section 6) specified
   below, provide the following important properties:

   *  Origins can express any useful configuration that is representable
      by HTTPS records, including multiple endpoints representing
      different ports, providers, etc.

   *  Origins that simply alias to a single target can indicate this
      without copying the ECHConfig and other parameters, avoiding the
      maintenance burden of staying synchronized with the target's key
      rotations and configuration updates.

   If the origin makes use of intermediaries, it is the origin's
   responsibility to ensure that the origin-svcb JSON document correctly
   accounts for their current configuration.

   Note that there are multiple, and possibly confusing, port numbers
   involved here.  The port that is part of the web origin in the .well-
   known URL is part of the QNAME that will be used by clients in
   accessing the origin's HTTPS/SVCB resource records.  The "port" field
   in the RR value, and in the JSON structure, is the value to be used
   in specifying an "alternative endpoint" as defined in section 1.3
   [RFC9460].

6.  Zone Factory behaviour

   The behaviours of the zone factory can be divided into two
   categories: behaviors that occur once, when configuring the zone
   factory to use a JSON document, and synchronization behaviors that
   occur on an ongoing basis after configuration is complete.

6.1.  Configuration behaviours

   In its default configuration, the zone factory SHOULD NOT perform
   record synthesis from any origin-svcb JSON documents.  Activating
   record synthesis SHOULD require a configuration change by the
   operator.  This avoids surprising additions of records to the DNS
   zone.

   A zone factory MAY offer a configuration option (off by default) to
   detect A and AAAA records in the DNS zone that correspond to HTTP
   origins with a well-known JSON resource, and automatically synthesize
   HTTPS records for all such origins.  This procedure can work when the
   A or AAAA records' owner name is sufficient to generate the correct
   "https://" URL for the well-known JSON resource.  Note that this
   mechanism is limited to "https://" origins with a port number of 443.

   To generate specific HTTPS records, a zone factory MAY offer a
   configuration option to specify a list of secure HTTP origins.  The
   zone factory can use these origins to produce well-known URIs (to
   retrieve the origin-svcb JSON resource) and port-prefixed owner names
   (for the generated HTTPS records).

   To generate records with arbitrary SVCB-compatible record types, a
   zone factory MAY allow the operator to configure the full owner name
   and record type of the records to be generated, and the full URL or
   local filesystem path of an origin-svcb resource.  A full URL is
   required because there is not, in general, an HTTP origin that is
   intrinsically authorized to control the content of a SVCB-compatible
   DNS record.

Internet-Draft           Well-Known URI for SVCB            October 2025


6.2.  Ongoing synchronization behaviours

   If the ZF is unable to convert the JSON into a DNS zone fragment
   (e.g., due to an unrecognized SvcParamKey), or if the resulting zone
   fails validation checks, the ZF MUST NOT update the DNS.  Such
   failures will not be directly visible to the client-facing server, so
   ZF implementations will need to provide some form of reporting so
   that the situation can be resolved.  Note that this can lead to
   inconsistent behavior for a single origin served by multiple ZFs.

   A ZF MAY apply additional processing according to its own policy,
   such as adjusting TTL values and correcting common misconfigurations.

   A ZF SHOULD check that ECH with the presented endpoints succeeds with
   the backend before publication.  In order to make such checks, the ZF
   SHOULD attempt to access the well-known URI defined here while
   attempting ECH.

   A bespoke TLS client is likely needed for this check, that does not
   require the ECHConfigList value to have already been published in the
   DNS.  The TLS client also needs to allow checking for the success or
   failure of ECH.

   Note that the ECHConfigList could contain some ECHConfig values that
   work and some that deliberately do not work if, for example, the TLS
   server wishes to GREASE it's ECHConfigList according to
   [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] section 6.2.2.

   If ipv4hints or ipv6hints are present, and if those are not the same
   values as are published in A/AAAA RRs for the backend, then the ZF
   SHOULD check that webPKI based authentication of the backend works at
   all of the relevant addresses.

   A ZF SHOULD publish all the endpoints that are presented in the JSON
   file that pass the checks above.

   A ZF SHOULD set a DNS TTL less than regeninterval, i.e. short enough
   so that any cached DNS resource records are likely to have expired
   before the JSON object's content is likely to have changed.  The ZF
   MUST attempt to refresh the JSON object and regenerate the zone
   before this time.  This aims to ensure that ECHConfig values are not
   used longer than intended by backend.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a way to publish SVCB/HTTPS RR values.  If the
   wrong values were published in the DNS, then TLS clients using ECH
   might suffer a privacy leak, or degraded service due to overuse of
   ECH retry_configs.

   Similarly, a ZF that also has write access to A/AAAA RRs for a
   backend, SHOULD NOT publish HTTPS RRs that contain ipv4hints or
   ipv6hints that are in conflict with the correct A/AAAA values unless
   those have been verified (via webPKI) as belonging to the same
   backend.

   When considering the content of SVCB/HTTPS RRs, the general argument
   for the security of this scheme is that this scheme has the backend
   server authenticate the JSON structure that is mapped directly to the
   SVCB/HTTPS RR, to eventually be used by TLS clients when interacting
   with the backend server, via the client-facing server.  Note that if
   an SVCB record is being published to support access via some non-HTTP
   protocol, then additional checks may be required.

   If a ZF is also authoritative for the CAA RR [RFC8659] for a CFS,
   then, as part of verifying the origin of the .well-known JSON, that
   ZF is in a position to evaluate whether the CA that issues the CFS
   TLS server certificate was authorized to do so at the time of
   issuance.  A check of this kind can reduce exposure to attacks by an
   untrustworthy CA.

   ECH split-mode security also requires that the backend server acquire
   SvcParamKey values from the client-facing server via some
   authenticated means.  If the backend server acquires the JSON data
   from the well-known URL and it is properly authenticated via HTTPS
   from the client-facing server's public_name then that satisfies this
   requirement.

   The system described here depends on the webPKI for authentication of
   entities and results in publication of new SVCB/HTTPS RRs.  The
   webPKI itself, however, often depends on the DNS to demonstrate
   control over a DNS name, e.g. when using the ACME protocol [RFC8555]
   with the HTTP-01 challenge type.  A temporary breach of a backend
   server that allows the attacker to contol the JSON content described
   here could be used to bootstrap more long-lasting control over the
   backend's DNS name if the attacker were to request new certificates
   during the time when the attacker's chosen values were published in
   the DNS, and if the ACME server doing the validation solely depended
   on content from the backend's HTTPS RR, e.g. preferring ipv6hints
   over the AAAA for the backend.  It would seem prudent for ACME
   servers to be cautious if using ipv4hints and ipv6hints, e.g.
   flagging divergence between those values and A/AAAA RRs.

   Although the .well-known URL defined here may well be publicly
   accessible, general HTTP clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use this
   resource in lieu of HTTPS records queries through their preferred DNS
   server for the following reasons:

   *  The bootstrap connection would not be able to use ECH, so it would
      reveal all the information that ECH seeks to protect.

   *  The origin could serve the user with a uniquely identifying
      configuration, potentially resulting in an unexpected tracking
      vector.

   Operators should be careful to avoid directory enumeration or
   traversal attacks if the well-known URLs are served directly from a
   filesystem.  For example, a misconfiguration of this kind could
   expose the ECH private keys.

   In multi-CDN and similar scenarios, a ZF might only test ECH success
   against one of the CDNs unless the ZF can make use of the ipv4hints
   and/or ipv6hint values, or the ZF has out of band information about
   the different addresses at which backend.example.com can be accessed.

   This document doesn't specify how origins are added to the list used
   by a ZF, nor how those are deleted, nor does it specify how a CFS
   might signal to a ZF that it wishes all HTTPS RRs to be deleted.

   To reduce the frequency of DNS zone updates, ZF implementations MAY
   defer any DNS updates until they detect a a change to the JSON value.
   Changes can be detected using HTTP cache headers, comparison of
   normalized JSON or internal data structures to a cached copy, or
   comparison of the generated DNS records (including TTLs) with those
   currently published in the zone.  If DNS records are retrieved for
   this purpose using a DNS query, it MUST use an authenticated secure

   transport directly to the authoritative server, in order to ensure
   integrity of the returned TTL value.  For clarity: a localhost
   connection between the ZF implementation and the authoritative server
   process that does not use the system stub resolver is considered
   sufficently secure for this protocol, should that be an acceptable
   local policy.

   Using this protocol, a ZF SHOULD only publish RRs for origins that
   are actively taking part in this protocol.  If an origin used to use
   this protocol, but has since stopped, and if a ZF was still polling
   for that origin's .well-known and the origin hadn't deleted the
   origin-svcb JSON, then undesired publication of RRs could occur.
   Implementations SHOULD take steps to try ensure such accidental
   publication does not happen.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The -00 WG draft replaces draft-farrell-tls-wkesni-03.

   Version 01 changed from a special-purpose design, carrying only
   ECHConfigs and port numbers, to a more general approach based on
   Service Bindings.

   Version 02 is just a keep-alive

   Version 03 reflects some local implementation experience with -02

   Version 04 matches a proof-of-concept bash script implementation and
   results of IETF-117 discussion.

   Version 05 updated the IANA and Security considerations and fixed
   conformance to HTTPS SVCB spec.  It also addressed early artart and
   dnsop reviews, and some list discussion/github issues.

   Version 06 changed the name and some of the text because it is no
   longer ECH-specific.

   Version 07 clarifies that origins only speak for themselves and has
   editorial changes and clarifications.

   Version 08 resolves a number of issues identified in discussion
   between authors and arising from implementation and (a very tiny)
   deployment.

   Version 09 generalised the text some more in response to comments at
   IETF-123 and resolved a few more issues and updated the acks section.
