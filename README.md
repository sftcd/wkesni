# wkesni

A well-known URI for publishing ECHConfigList values from a web server.  The
[Internet draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-wkech) is an
IETF TLS WG draft specification.

[This](draft-ietf-tls-wkech.txt) is the local copy. 

There is an implementation [here](https://github.com/defo-project/zone-factory/tree/mo-dep)
that uses a mixture of bash scripting (for the CFS) and python (for the ZF).

(ECH used be called ESNI, hence the repo name.)
