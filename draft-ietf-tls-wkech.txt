         A well-known URI for publishing ECHConfigList values.
                        draft-ietf-tls-wkech-05

Abstract

   We define a well-known URI at which an HTTP origin can inform an
   authoritative DNS server, or other interested parties, about its
   Service Bindings.  The data can include Encrypted ClientHello (ECH)
   configurations, allowing the origin, in collaboration with DNS
   infrastructure elements, to publish and rotate its own ECH keys.

1.  Introduction

   Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] for TLS1.3 [RFC8446]
   defines a confidentiality mechanism for server names and other
   ClientHello content in TLS.  Many applications will require
   publication of ECHConfigList data structures in the DNS, where an
   ECHConfigList structure contains a list of ECHConfig values.  Each
   ECHConfig value contains the public component of a key pair that will
   typically be periodically (re-)generated by a web server.  Many web
   infrastructures will have an API that can be used to dynamically
   update the DNS RR values containing ECHConfigList values.  Some
   deployments, however, will not, and those deployments could benefit
   from a mechanism like the one defined here.

   Note that this is not intended for universal deployment, but rather
   for cases where the web server doesn't have write access to the
   relevant zone file (or equivalent).  That zone file will eventually
   include an HTTPS or SVCB RR [I-D.ietf-tls-svcb-ech] containing the
   ECHConfigList.  This mechanism is extensible to deliver other kinds
   of information about the origin, that can be of use in these

   circumstances, but is mainly intended to provide the functionality
   necessary for ongoing management of ECH keys.

   We use the term "zone factory" (ZF) for the entity that does have
   write access to the zone file.  We assume the ZF can also make HTTPS
   requests to the web server with the ECH keys.  We define a well-known
   URI [RFC8615] on the web server that allows the ZF to poll for
   changes to ECHConfigList values.  For example, if a web server
   generates new ECHConfigList values hourly and publishes those at the
   well-known URI, the ZF can poll that URI.  When the ZF sees new
   values, it can check if those work, and if they do, then update the
   zone file and re-publish the zone.

   If ECH is being operated in split-mode then the web server (backend)
   can similarly poll the ECH client-facing server at the well-known URI
   and then create it's own value to publish for the ZF to read.  ECH
   split-mode is defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-esni] and some examples are
   shown below (Section 3).

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We define or re-use the following terms:

   o  Zone factory (ZF): an entity that has write-access to the DNS
   o  Client-Facing Server: the web server that has an ECH private
      value.  This processes the outer ClientHello and attempts ECH
      decryption.  The name of client-facing server will typically be
      the public_name value used in an ECHConfig.
   o  Backend: the web server that will process the inner ClientHello.
      Note that even if client-facing server and backend are on the same
      web server, they almost certainly have different DNS names.
   o  Shared-mode: this is where client-facing and backend servers are
      the same web server.
   o  Split-mode: this refers to the case where the client-facing server
      only does ECH decryption but the TLS session is between the client
      and backend, which will typically be on a different host to
      client-facing server
   o  regeninterval: the number of seconds after which the value
      retrieved after acessing a well-known URI may be changed.

         Figure 1: Shared-Mode Topology with Zone Factory and DNS

   The shared-mode ECH server generates new ECHConfigList values every
   "regeninterval" seconds via some regular, automated process (e.g., a
   cronjob).  ECHConfigList values are "current" for an hour, and remain
   usable for three hours from the time of generation.  The automated
   process updates the ECHConfigList values in a JSON resource (see
   Figure 3) at the well-known URI, https://backend.example.com/.well-
   known/origin-svcb.

   These steps then occur.

   1.  On the ZF, another regularly executed job uses an HTTP client to
       retrieve this JSON resource from backend.example.com.  The data
       MUST be fetched via HTTPS and the certificate validity MUST be
       verified.
   2.  The ZF next attempts to connect to backend.example.com using
       these ECH values and confirms that they are working.

Internet-Draft           Well-Known URI for ECH                June 2024


   3.  The ZF observes that the JSON resource has a regeninterval of
       3600 seconds, and chooses a DNS TTL of 1800.  It updates the DNS
       zone file for backend.example.com and re-publishes the zone
       containing only the new ECHConfigList values.

   When "regeninterval" seconds have passed, the ZF attempts to refresh
   its cached copy of the JSON resource.  If the resource has changed,
   it repeats this process.

3.2.  Split-mode, multi-CDN deplpoyment.

   The following diagram, and this entire section, is a place-holder and
   is likely to change.

   In this topology, the overall process is similar, but certain actions
   must be repeated as described below.

   1.  On the ZF, another regularly executed job uses an HTTP client to
       retrieve this JSON resource from the configured intermediaries.
       The data MUST be fetched via HTTPS and the certificate validity
       MUST be verified.  It is TBD how the ZF knows the intermediaries.
   2.  The ZF next attempts to connect to each intermediary using the
       ECH values and confirms that they are working.
   3.  IT is TBD how the ZF sets the priorities for the backends.

4.  The origin-svcb well-known URI

   If the backend wants to convey information to the Zone Factory, it
   publishes the JSON content defined in Section 5 at:
   https://backend.example.com/.well-known/origin-svcb

   The well-known URI defined here MUST be an https URL and therefore
   the ZF can verify the correct backend is being accessed.

   If no new ECHConfig value verifies (as per Section 6), then the zone
   factory MUST NOT modify the zone.

5.  The JSON structure for origin service binding info

   [[ NOTE: JSON structure is a work in progress.]]

       {
           "endpoints": [{
               "regeninterval": 3600,
               "priority": 1,
               "target": "cdn.example.",

        {
           "endpoints": [{
               "alias": "cdn1.example.net",
               "regeninterval": 108000
           }, {
               "alias": "cdn2.example.com",
               "regeninterval": 108000
           }]
         }

                    Figure 4: Sample JSON with aliasing

   The JSON file at the well-known URI MUST contain an object with an
   "endpoints" key that contains an array of objects that each map to a
   desired HTTPS/SVCB resource record that the backend would like to see
   published.  The endpoints is an array whose elements each represent
   HTTPS records in ServiceMode or AliasMode as described below.  Each
   element MAY contain one or more keys from the JSON Service Binding
   Info registry (see IANA Considerations).  The initial registry
   entries are:

   o  regeninterval: the number of seconds between key generation
      actions at the origin, i.e. a replacement ECHConfigList may be
      generated this often.
   o  priority: The value is a positive integer corresponding to the
      SvcPriority.  If omitted, the zone factory SHOULD infer
      numerically increasing SvcPriority from the order of the endpoints
      array.
   o  target: The value is a string containing a fully qualified domain
      name, corresponding to the HTTPS record's TargetName.  The default
      value is ".".  All labels in the name MUST contain only octets
      from the ABNF set ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_".
   o  alias: The value MUST be a DNS name that could be used as the
      TargetName of an HTTPS resource record.  This indicates that the
      backend is hosted on the same endpoints as this target, and is
      equivalent to an HTTPS AliasMode record.  The ZF might implement
      this directive by publishing an AliasMode record, publishing a
      CNAME record, copying HTTPS records from the target zone, or
      fetching https://cfs.example.com/.well-known/origin-svcb" (if it
      exists).  In this case, the regeninterval indicates that backend
      does not plan to change the content at the URL for at least that
      number of seconds.  If an alias entry is present then any ech and
      port entries (if also present) MUST be ignored.
   o  params: A JSON Dictionary representing the SVCB SvcParams.  Each
      key in the dictionary is a string containing a registered
      SvcParamKey name (e.g. "ipv6hint") or a SvcParamKey in generic
      form (e.g., "key65528").

      *  For single-valued SvcParams (e.g., "ech"), the value is a JSON
         String.  A JSON String is a sequence of Unicode codepoints,
         while a SvcParam's presentation value is a sequence of octets,
         so each value octet is stored as a single Unicode codepoint
         [ISOMORPHIC-DECODE].  In almost all cases, this is equivalent
         to the ordinary string representation of the presentation
         value.
      *  For list-valued SvcParams (e.g., "alpn"), the value is a JSON
         Array of Strings.  Each String represents an octet sequence, as
         in the single-value case.

   An empty endpoint object corresponds to an HTTPS record with inferred
   SvcPriority, TargetName=".", and no ECH support.  An empty record of
   this kind can be useful as a simple way to make use of the HTTPS RR
   type's HSTS behavior.

   If the ZF is unable to convert the JSON into a DNS zone (e.g., due to
   an unrecognized SvcParamKey), or if the resulting zone fails
   validation checks, the ZF MUST NOT update the DNS.  Such failures
   will not be directly visible to the client-facing server, so ZF
   implementations will need to provide some form of reporting so that
   the situation can be resolved.  Note that this can lead to
   inconsistent behavior for a single origin served by multiple ZFs.

   A ZF MAY apply additional processing according to its own policy,
   such as adjusting TTL values and correcting common misconfigurations.

   This arrangement provides the following important properties:

   o  Origins can indicate that different ECHConfigs are used on
      different ports.
   o  Origins can indicate that multiple CDNs are in use, each with its
      own ECHConfig.
   o  Origins that simply alias to a single target can indicate this
      without copying the ECHConfig and other parameters, which can
      interfere with key rotation and other maintenance.
   o  "port" and "target" are generally sufficient to uniquely identify
      a ServiceMode record, so zone factories can use the endpoint list
      to add ECH to pre-existing ServiceMode records that may have other
      SvcParams.

6.  Zone factory behaviour

   ZF SHOULD check that ECH with the presented endpoints succeeds with
   the backend before publication.  In order to make such checks, the ZF

Internet-Draft           Well-Known URI for ECH                June 2024


   A bespoke TLS client is likely needed for this check, that does not
   require the ECHConfigList value to have already been published in the
   DNS.  The TLS client also needs to allow checking for the success or
   failure of ECH.

   If more than one ECHConfig is present in an ECHConfigList, then the
   ZF SHOULD explode the ECHConfigList value presented into "singleton"
   values with one public key in each, and then test each of those
   separately.

   ZF SHOULD publish all the endpoints that are presented in the JSON
   file that pass the checks above.

   ZF SHOULD set a DNS TTL less than regeninterval, i.e. short enough so
   that any cached DNS resource records are likely to have expired
   before the JSON object's content is likely to have changed.  The ZF
   MUST attempt to refresh the JSON object and regenerate the zone
   before this time.  This aims to ensure that ECHConfig values are not
   used longer than intended by backend.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines another way to publish ECHConfigList values.
   If the wrong keys were read from here and published in the DNS, then
   clients using ECH would do the wrong thing, likely resulting in
   denial of service, or a privacy leak, or worse, when TLS clients
   attempt to use ECH with a backend web site.  So: Don't do that:-)

   Although this configuration resource MAY be publicly accessible,
   general HTTP clients SHOULD NOT attempt to use this resource in lieu
   of HTTPS records queries through their preferred DNS server for the
   following reasons:

   o  The bootstrap connection would not be able to use ECH, so it would
      reveal all the information that ECH seeks to protect.
   o  The origin could serve the user with a uniquely identifying
      configuration, potentially resulting in an unexpected tracking
      vector.

   The .well-known URI chosen here means that services running on
   different ports of the same backend are trusting the service running
   on the default port (443) for that backend to provide correct
   endpoint information.

   As described, in mutlti-CDN and simlar scenarios, a ZF might only
   test ECH success against one of the CDNs unless the ZF can make use
   of the ipv4hints and/or ipv6hint values, or the ZF has out of band

   Thanks to Niall O'Reilly, Martin Thomson and David Black for reviews.

   Stephen Farrell's work on this specification was supported in part by
   the Open Technology Fund.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to take two actions: registering a new well-known
   URI in the registry at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-
   uris/well-known-uris.xhtml#well-known-uris-1> and creating a new
   registry for defining items in the JSON object found at that
   endpoint.

9.1.  Well-known endpoint registration

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the Well-Known URIs
   table:

      URI Suffix: origin-svcb
      Change Controller: IETF
      Reference: {This RFC}
      Status: permanent
      Related Information: Must be fetched via HTTPS
      Date Registered: {When registered}
      Date Modified:

   Items in curly braces should be replaced with their actual values.

9.2.  JSON Service Binding Info

   If approved, this specification requests the creation of an IANA
   registry named "JSON Service Binding Info" with a Standards Action
   registration policy.  The table has three columns:

      Name: the name of the top-level field being added
      Reference: the document that defines the semantics of the field
      Notes: any short additional information the registrant wishes to
      add

   The table should be populated with the following two entries, where
   Items in curly braces should be replaced with their actual values,
   and the "Notes" column is empty.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   [[ NOTE: RFC editor: please remove this before publication.  ]]

   The -00 WG draft replaces draft-farrell-tls-wkesni-03.

   Version 01 changed from a special-purpose design, carrying only
   ECHConfigs and port numbers, to a more general approach based on
   Service Bindings.

   Version 02 is just a keep-alive

   Version 03 reflects some local implementation experience with -02

   Version 04 matches a proof-of-concept bash script implementation and
   results of IETF-117 discussion.

   Version 05 responds to early artart and dnsop reviews, and some list
   discussion/github issues.
