# ECH keys update as per draft-ietf-tls-wkech-02
# with the addition of 'regeninterval' to the JSON
# and (so far) without support for the 'alias' option
# This is a work-in-progress, DON'T DEPEND ON THIS!!

# This script handles ECH key updating for an ECH front-end (in ECH split-mode),
# back-end (e.g. web server) or zone factory (the thing that publishes DNS RRs
# containing ECH public values).

# variables/settings, some can be overwritten from environment

# where the ECH-enabled OpenSSL is built, needed if ECH-checking is enabled

# Key update frequency - we publish keys for 2 x the "main"
# duration and add a new key each time and retire (as in don't 
# load to server) old keys after 3 x this duration.
# So, keys remain usable for 3 x this, and are visible to the
# Internet for 2 x this. 
# Old keys are just moved into $ECHOLD for now and are deleted
# once they're 5 x this duration old.
# We request a TTL for that the RR containing keys be half 
# this duration.
REGENINTERVAL="3600" # 1 hour

# Key filename convention is "*.ech" for key files but 
# "*.pem.ech" for short-terms key files that'll be moved
# aside

# Long term key files, can be space-sep list if needed
# These won't be expired out ever, and will be added to
# the list of keys we ask be published. This is mostly
# for testing.
